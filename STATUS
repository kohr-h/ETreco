Development status of ETreco

This software is currently in experimental status. This means that it does its job in some typical 
use cases but may fail in corner cases or exotic settings (corrupted data, untypical parameter 
values, ...). Moreover, the library functions haven't been thoroughly tested (e.g. via unit tests),
so there might be scenarios where programs show unexpected behavior (aka bugs).

Building works on both Linux and Mac OS X (under unknown conditions, however)

What works in typical use cases:

- Option handling
- Parameter input from config file
- Data I/O in MRC format
- Reconstruction with and without Lambda


What might work (untested):

- Reconstruction with shifted images or shifted volume
- Shifted Fourier transform

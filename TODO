TODO file for ETreco.


Urgent goals are (from most to least urgent, but still urgent):

- Fix bad scaling when volume is larger than projection 

- Implement the shifted backprojection

- Introduce tests to check if parameter values make sense

- Implement anisotropic mollifier by z shrink factor and corresponding flag

- Re-organize the code such that it is better re-usable for further programs (e.g. options)

- Fix exception handling: move code depending on success out of Try blocks

- Implement varying defocus with strip-wise deconvolution

- Use OpenMP to speed up further (first test if CException is thread-safe!)

- Fix various constants (factor before reco kernel, scaling, multiples of 2*pi etc.).
  (This is important for quantitative evaluation of reconstructions.)
  
- Make printing functions dependent on verbosity level
  
- Write function descriptions (doxygen style)





Further things to do in the future (not so urgent):

- Thoroughly test implementation of CTF, reco kernel and detector MTF

- Write unit tests and integrate them with DejaGnu or some other testing framework

- Shift code closer to the GNU coding style guidelines

- Implement NFFT functions e.g. for Born approximation computation

- Introduce a config option for double precision and adapt config test. Maybe introduce a config 
  switch to choose between single and double precision
